# truffle-tutorial-gbtoken
Tutorial project demonstrating Truffle's ease and ability to deploy contracts and interact with them via web3 and Javascript. We configure the project in truffle.js (and truffle-config.js for Windows PCs) to use a personal (Ganache) blockchain. This can be swapped out with another network (e.g. Ropsten testnet).


My notes (Aryan Mehra): Use the Interactions folder to create functions and various implementations and run them using the truffle exec command in the command prompt.


## Instructions for building this project yourself, from scratch.
Coming soon.
